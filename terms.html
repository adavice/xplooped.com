						days and followed by a 28-day charge - see relevant "Pricing" for your country below, unless
						terminated within the first 3 days. There will be a 1 EUR or 1 [local currency] charge for
						authorization purposes. This charge will be reverted back to you.<br />

						refunds in your statement. If you do not cancel your account within this time, your account will
						be automatically extended to a premium account at the cost of 13.95 EUR per month.
						Your account renews automatically on the 28-day of each month until you cancel your
						subscription.<br />
						By starting your XPlooped membership you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to
						charge you a monthly membership fee at the current rate, and any other charges you may incur in
						connection with your use of the provider service to the Payment Method you provided during
						registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).<br />

						You can use the following Payment Methods: Credit/debit card.<br />
						Please note that prices and charges are subject to change with notice. As used in these Terms of
						Use, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment
						Method. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your
						membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We
						automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the
						commencement of your paying membership. In some cases, your billing date may change, for
						example, if your Payment Method has not been successfully settled or if your premium membership
						began on the day not contained in a given month.<br />
						Membership charges are fully earned upon payment. You acknowledge that the amount billed each
						month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to
						promotional offers and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment
						Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges. For certain
						Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or
						related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. All the herein
						mentioned prices and charges shall be considered gross prices, and contain all the taxes,
						however they do not contain any commissions or charges you may incur in connection with the
						particular chosen Payment Method. If you choose to use the particular Payment Method, you
						declare acknowledgement and consent to its terms and use, and you accept making payment in this
						manner. Provider, within the limits allowed by law, is not responsible for any inconveniences or
						damages caused by usage of the particular Payment Method, especially delays or impossibility to
						make payment. In such cases you should complain about those services to their provider, in the
						manner provided by their terms and use. If the Payment was not accepted because of any reasons
						attributable to the provider, please contact us via e-mail address: support@xplooped.com. By
						the acceptance of hereby Terms of Use, you declare, that all the payments shall be made with the
						funds from a legitimate source. By the acceptance of hereby Terms of Use, you consent to pass
						your personal data (i.e.: name, surname, address, e-mail address and bank account number) to the
						provider of any Payment Method you chose, for the purpose of making the payment. Please note
						that if a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or
						otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the premium account
						services until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.<br />

						internet.<br />

					<h4>5.&nbsp;CANCELLATION</h4>
					<p>You may cancel your XPlooped membership at any time and you will continue to have access to the
						service through the end of your monthly billing period. Please note that you must cancel your
						subscription before it renews each Monthly Period in order to avoid the next billing. To cancel
						your account you may go to your account settings and choose to cancel the account. You may also
						e-mail us at support@xplooped.com.<br />
						If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current
						Monthly Period - this means that you will have continued access to the portal for the remainder
						of that period, but you will not receive a refund.<br />
						No-refunds: Please note that payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds for any
						partial-month membership periods or unused games. At any time, and for any reason, we may
						provide a refund or other consideration to some or all of our members. The amount of refund, and
						the decision to provide it, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of refund in
						one instance does not entitle you to refund in the future for similar instances, nor does it
						obligate us to provide refunds in the future, under any circumstance.<br />
						After any termination, you understand and acknowledge that we will have no further obligation to
						provide the Site or Services and all licenses and other rights granted to you by these Terms of
						Use will immediately cease. Provider will not be liable to you or any third party for
						termination of the Site or Services or termination of your use of either. Upon any termination
						or suspension, any content, materials or information (including user submissions or translated
						content) that you have submitted on the site or that which is related to your account may no
						longer be accessed by you. Furthermore, Provider will have no obligation to maintain any
						information stored in our database related to your account or to forward any information to you
						or any third party.<br />
						Any suspension, termination or cancellation will not affect your obligations to the provider
						under these Terms of Use (including, without limitation, proprietary rights and ownership,
						indemnification and limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to
						survive such suspension, termination or cancellation.
